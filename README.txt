A game based on the board game Onitama. It has a client and a server, made with the use of PodSixNet.

No arts were used on this game. Instead, the program creates basic shapes to represent the board and the cards.

Since it was one of my first projects, the code isn't that clean. And I apologize for it.

TO PLAY THE GAME:
  1) Download all the necessary files in folder DIST
  2) Run the Onitama0.4.exe
  3) If nobody is connected, go to the facebook page https://www.facebook.com/groups/366994350345150/
      to find friends to play with!
